# Gibson Framework Production Readiness - Requirements

## 1. Overview
Complete all stubbed, mocked, TODO, and non-production code in the Gibson Framework to achieve production readiness.

## 2. Problem Statement
The Gibson Framework has numerous incomplete implementations including:
- Mock data instead of database integration
- TODO comments throughout the codebase
- Placeholder implementations
- Hardcoded values for testing
- Incomplete service integrations

## 3. User Stories

### View Layer Database Integration
**AS A** developer using Gibson Framework
**I WANT** all view layer methods to use real database operations
**SO THAT** the application works with persistent data instead of mock data

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All getMock* functions replaced with DAO calls
- Credential management uses secure storage
- Scan operations persist to database
- Target operations use database
- Plugin data stored and retrieved from database
- Reports generated from real scan data

### Database Initialization
**AS A** user initializing Gibson
**I WANT** the database to be properly initialized with schema
**SO THAT** the application has a working data layer

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Database creation uses DAO factory
- All 8 migrations run automatically
- Database health check passes
- WAL mode enabled for concurrency
- Foreign key constraints enforced

### Security Enhancements
**AS A** security-conscious user
**I WANT** proper credential encryption and key management
**SO THAT** sensitive data is protected

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Master key stored securely (not hardcoded)
- Credentials encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- Proper user confirmation dialogs
- Input validation and sanitization
- No hardcoded test values in production

### Watch System Implementation
**AS A** system administrator
**I WANT** the watch system to actually monitor resources
**SO THAT** I can track system changes in real-time

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Target watcher lists actual targets
- Scan watcher monitors real scans
- Finding watcher tracks findings
- Credential watcher monitors credentials
- Proper synchronization counts

### Health Monitoring
**AS A** operations engineer
**I WANT** complete health monitoring
**SO THAT** I can ensure system reliability

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Disk space check implemented
- Real metrics collection
- Accurate status reporting
- Performance monitoring
