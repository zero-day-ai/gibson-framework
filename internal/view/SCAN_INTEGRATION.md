# Scan Service Integration Summary

## Implementation Completed

### Real Scan Execution Logic
- ✅ Implemented `executeScan()` method with real plugin coordination
- ✅ Plugin discovery and loading via plugin manager
- ✅ Concurrent plugin execution using worker pools
- ✅ Real finding storage to database via FindingService
- ✅ Scan progress tracking and status updates
- ✅ Plugin metrics recording via PluginService
- ✅ Error handling and scan failure reporting

### Service Layer Integration
- ✅ Integrated with ServiceFactory for dependency injection
- ✅ Uses ScanService for CRUD operations
- ✅ Uses TargetService for target validation
- ✅ Uses FindingService for finding storage
- ✅ Uses PluginService for metrics recording
- ✅ Proper database connectivity via DAO layer

### Batch Scanning with Worker Pools
- ✅ Implemented `RunBatchScan()` with concurrent execution
- ✅ Uses `pool.NewScannerPool()` for controlled concurrency
- ✅ Progress tracking for batch operations
- ✅ Result aggregation and export capabilities
- ✅ Atomic counters for thread-safe statistics

### Output Formatting
- ✅ JSON, YAML, and table output formats
- ✅ Detailed and summary views for scan results
- ✅ Finding filtering by severity and category
- ✅ Export functionality for results
- ✅ Real-time progress reporting

### View Methods Updated
- ✅ `StartScan()` - Creates and executes real scans
- ✅ `ListScans()` - Lists scans from database
- ✅ `GetScanResults()` - Retrieves real findings from database
- ✅ `RunBatchScan()` - Parallel batch scanning with worker pools
- ✅ `StopScan()`, `GetScanStatus()`, `DeleteScan()` - Service integration

## Key Features

### Plugin Coordination
- Plugin discovery from filesystem
- Dynamic plugin loading and unloading
- Plugin filtering support
- Health checks and error recovery
- Resource usage tracking

### Concurrency & Performance
- Worker pool-based execution
- Atomic counters for thread safety
- Progress reporting
- Timeout handling
- Graceful shutdown

### Database Integration
- Scan lifecycle management (pending → running → completed/failed)
- Finding persistence with metadata
- Plugin metrics recording
- Target and credential integration

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error logging
- Scan failure marking
- Plugin execution error recovery
- Resource cleanup on errors

## Breaking Changes

### Constructor Change
```go
// OLD:
func NewScanView() *scanView

// NEW:
func NewScanView() (*scanView, error)
```

**Impact**: All code calling `NewScanView()` must handle the error return.

## Usage Example

```go
// Create scan view with service integration
scanView, err := view.NewScanView()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Failed to initialize scan view:", err)
}

// Start a scan
err = scanView.StartScan(ctx, view.ScanStartOptions{
    Target:  "my-target",
    Type:    "advanced",
    Plugins: "plugin1,plugin2",
    Output:  "json",
})

// Run batch scan
err = scanView.RunBatchScan(ctx, view.ScanBatchOptions{
    Targets:   []string{"target1", "target2", "target3"},
    Type:      "basic",
    Workers:   3,
    Progress:  true,
    Aggregate: true,
    ExportFile: "batch-results.json",
    Output:    "json",
})
```

## Next Steps Required

1. **Update CLI Commands**: Modify any CLI commands that use `NewScanView()` to handle the error return
2. **Plugin Directory**: Ensure plugins directory exists at `~/.gibson/plugins/`
3. **Database Schema**: Ensure all required tables exist (scans, targets, findings, plugin_stats, etc.)
4. **Plugin Development**: Create actual security plugins that implement the `shared.SecurityPlugin` interface

## Architecture Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: View layer focuses on presentation, service layer handles business logic
- **Testability**: Services can be mocked for unit testing
- **Scalability**: Worker pool pattern allows controlled resource usage
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture allows easy addition of new security tests
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and metrics collection
- **Reliability**: Error recovery and graceful degradation
