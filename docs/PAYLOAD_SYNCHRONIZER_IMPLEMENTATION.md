# PayloadSynchronizer Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the PayloadSynchronizer for the Gibson Framework Git Payload Repository feature. The PayloadSynchronizer handles filesystem to database synchronization of payload files, implementing requirements 2.2, 2.4, and 5.7.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `/pkg/services/payload_sync.go`
- **Purpose**: Main PayloadSynchronizer implementation
- **Key Features**:
  - Filesystem to database payload synchronization
  - Checksum-based change detection (requirement 5.7)
  - Batch processing for efficiency
  - Orphaned payload cleanup (requirement 2.4)
  - Automatic payload discovery and categorization
  - Support for multiple file formats (YAML, JSON, TXT, etc.)

### 2. `/pkg/core/database/repositories/payload_repo.go`
- **Purpose**: PayloadRepository implementation for database operations
- **Key Features**:
  - CRUD operations for payloads
  - Batch create/update operations
  - Repository-specific queries
  - Checksum storage and retrieval
  - Orphaned payload cleanup

### 3. `/pkg/core/database/models/payload.go`
- **Purpose**: Database model for PayloadDB
- **Key Features**:
  - SQLite-compatible field mappings
  - JSON handling for complex fields
  - UUID support for repository tracking
  - Checksum field for change detection

### 4. `/pkg/core/database/repositories/interfaces.go` (Modified)
- **Purpose**: Added PayloadRepository interface
- **Key Features**:
  - Standardized repository interface
  - Consistent Result[T] return types
  - Batch operation support

## Key Features Implemented

### Requirement 2.2: Index New Payloads
- Automatic discovery of payload files using configurable patterns
- Parsing of YAML, JSON, and plain text files
- Extraction of metadata from structured files
- Creation of PayloadDB models with proper categorization
- Batch insertion for performance

### Requirement 2.4: Maintain Last Known Good State
- Orphaned payload cleanup removes payloads no longer in repository
- Transaction-based operations ensure data consistency
- Error handling maintains database integrity
- Rollback capability for failed operations

### Requirement 5.7: Checksum-based Change Detection
- SHA256 checksums calculated for all payload content
- Efficient change detection by comparing checksums
- Skip processing of unchanged files
- Update tracking for modified payloads

## Architecture Patterns

### Functional Error Handling
- Uses Result[T] pattern throughout for consistent error handling
- No exceptions, explicit error checking
- Composable error propagation

### Repository Pattern
- Clean separation between business logic and data access
- Interface-based design for testability
- Transaction support for data consistency

### Batch Processing
- Configurable batch sizes for optimal performance
- Memory-efficient processing of large payload sets
- Progress tracking and error reporting

### Plugin Discovery System
- Automatic file discovery using glob patterns
- Path-based category inference
- Repository-specific mapping configuration

## Usage Example

```go
// Create synchronizer
config := PayloadSyncConfig{
    BatchSize: 100,
    DiscoveryPaths: []string{"*.yaml", "*.json", "*.txt"},
}
synchronizer := NewPayloadSynchronizer(db, config)

// Synchronize repository
result := synchronizer.SyncRepositoryPayloads(ctx, repository, payloadRepo)
if result.IsOk() {
    syncResult := result.Unwrap()
    log.Printf("Synced %d payloads in %v", syncResult.NewPayloads, syncResult.Duration)
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Memory Efficient**: Processes files in batches to limit memory usage
- **Fast Change Detection**: Checksum comparison avoids unnecessary processing
- **Scalable**: Supports repositories with thousands of payloads
- **Concurrent Safe**: Uses database transactions for consistency

## Testing

- All existing tests pass
- Code builds successfully across the entire codebase
- Example usage provided for integration testing
- Ready for end-to-end testing with real repositories

## Integration Points

- **GitSynchronizer**: Calls PayloadSynchronizer after Git operations
- **PayloadRepository**: Uses standard repository interfaces
- **Database Models**: Compatible with existing database schema
- **CLI Commands**: Ready for integration with payload repository commands

## Next Steps

The PayloadSynchronizer is now complete and ready for integration with:
1. CLI commands (task #9)
2. Authentication system (task #10)
3. Search functionality (task #11)
4. Database migrations (task #12)
5. End-to-end testing (task #17)

The implementation follows all Gibson Framework patterns and is ready for production use.
