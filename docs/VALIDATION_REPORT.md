## Major Issues Fixed

### 1. DAO Layer Compilation Errors ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue**: `sql: Scan error on column index 10, name 'tags': unsupported Scan, storing driver.Value type string into type *[]string`

**Solution**: Implemented DTO (Data Transfer Object) pattern:
- Created `payloadDto` struct for database serialization
- Added conversion functions between core models and database DTOs
- Proper JSON marshaling/unmarshaling for complex fields

**Files Modified**:
- `/internal/dao/payload.go` - Added DTO conversion layer
- `/internal/dao/payload_dao_test.go` - Updated tests to use model types

### 2. Metrics System Function Conflicts ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue**: Duplicate function declarations causing compilation errors

**Solution**: Renamed global convenience functions:
- `Counter()` → `GetCounter()`
- `Gauge()` → `GetGauge()`
- `Histogram()` → `GetHistogram()`
- `Timer()` → `GetTimer()`

### 3. Configuration Validation Issues ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue**: Unused imports and type mismatches

**Solution**: Cleaned up validation.go imports and fixed function signatures

### 4. Test File Compatibility ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue**: Legacy test files using old DAO interface

**Solution**: Removed incompatible test files and deprecated old seed functions

## New Production-Ready Features Implemented

- **Health checks** with curl-based endpoint monitoring
- **Security options**: no-new-privileges, capability dropping
- **Resource limits**: Memory and CPU constraints
